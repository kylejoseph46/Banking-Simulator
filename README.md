# OOP CPP Banking App
I created a textual banking app in C++ using Object Oriented Programming techniques like data abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance.

Here is the contents: 
The user has access to a bank account. Within the bank account the user can create an account, login, and if the user enters the password wrong too many times they will be prompted to make a new password. And then the options after logging in are: depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the balance, transferring money, and checking interest accumulation. And all of these operations can be done in both checkings and savings accounts.
